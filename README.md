implicit conversion: happens automatically if no data will be lost in the conversion. That’s why it’s possible to convert an int (which can hold less data) to a double (which can hold more), but not the other way around.
explicit conversion: requires a cast operator to convert a data type into another one. So if we do want to convert a double to an int, we could use the operator (int).

There are several built-in methods that we can use to manipulate numerical data and perform more complex mathematical calculations. Here are a few:
- Math.Abs()—will find the absolute value of a number. Example: Math.Abs(-5) returns 5.
- Math.Sqrt()—will find the square root of a number. Example: Math.Sqrt(16) returns 4.
- Math.Floor()—will round the given double or decimal down to the nearest whole number. Example: Math.Floor(8.65) returns 8.
- Math.Min()—returns the smaller of two numbers. Example: Math.Min(39, 12) returns 12.

.Substring() grabs part of a string using the specified character position and continues until the end of the string and returns a new string. 
.IndexOf() is usually used first to get the specific character position.

methods - A method is a reusable set of instructions that perform a specific task.
